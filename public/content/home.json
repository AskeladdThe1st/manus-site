  "intro1Title": "What Archon is",
  "intro1Copy": "An AI firm focused on specialized agents. We ship agents, the frameworks that power them, and the playbooks to run them safely.",
  "intro2Title": "Why AI agents matter",
  "intro2Copy": "Agents turn AI into clear roles: tutors, interviewers, reviewers. With defined scope, you can measure outcomes and earn trust from teams.",
  "intro3Title": "What makes Archon different",
  "intro3Copy": "We design for governance from day one. Every agent ships with constraints, evaluation loops, and integration paths instead of ad-hoc prompts.",
  "whyHeading": "Why Specialized Agents?",
  "whyPara1": "Intelligence scales better when responsibility is narrow. Specialized agents have a clear role, operate within defined constraints, and are easier to evaluate, improve, and trust.",
  "whyPara2": "Generalist systems try to do everything; they become unpredictable, harder to govern, and break accountability. Clarity beats cleverness in production systems.",
